Steve was first subpoenaed to a federal grand jury related to indigenous
 resistance at Standing Rock in 2017. 
He refused to cooperate then. 
Now, 4 years later, he has been dragged in front of another grand jury investigating NO DAPL resistance. He is currently incarcerated for again standing by his principles and refusing to cooperate.
